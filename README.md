# Perceptron NAND Gate Modeling

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook detailing a task completed for the Intelligent Systems course as part of the Bioinformatics degree at the University of Málaga. It demonstrates the process of modeling a NAND gate using a single-layer perceptron, a foundational concept in neural networks and digital logic.

## Project Structure
- `NAND_Perceptron.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook with step-by-step explanations, code, and visualizations.
- `plots`: This directory contains the visualizations of the decision boundary evolution and convergence plot.
